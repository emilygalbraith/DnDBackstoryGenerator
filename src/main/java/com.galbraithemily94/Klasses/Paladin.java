//    A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching
//    darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of
//    righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins
//    are devoted to gods of good, a paladinâ€™s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.
//    Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so,
//    their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the
//    wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.
