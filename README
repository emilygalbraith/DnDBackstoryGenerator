DnD Backstory Generator

I decided to create this project to help reinforce what I am learning at Tech Elevator along while creating something
useful to me. As any DnD player knows, creating a new character backstory can be a very time consuming labor of love.
Sometimes you're inspired and have an idea, sometimes you just need a quick one for an NPC, sometimes you just need a
starting point. That's where the DnD Backstory Generator comes in. When you need a jumping off point for a new character.

A user can choose to input information such as race, class, background, age, family info, name, and location. Or if not
the generator will randomly select choices for you. Based on these choices the generator will create a MadLibs like
backstory filling in the blanks.
