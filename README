DnD Backstory Generator

I decided to create this project to help reinforce what I am learning at Tech Elevator along with creating something
useful to me. As any DnD player knows, creating a new character backstory can be a very time consuming labor of love.
Sometimes you're inspired and have an idea, sometimes you just need a quick one for an NPC, sometimes you just need a
starting point. That's where the DnD Backstory Generator comes in. When you need a jumping off point for a new character.

A user can choose to input information such as race, class, background, age, and name. Whatever information is not chosen
will then be randomly generated. Based on these selections the Backstory generator will create a MadLibs like backstory
filling in the blanks with randomly selected sentences.

Future goals for this project:

After the initial goals are completed I am hoping to add a feature that will take the created character and be able to
generate a character sheet in a pdf format.

Additionally, while creating the backstory generation I did some light research on Backus-Naur Form. I plan to keep
learning about this, and hopefully be able to revamp the story creation to utilize these principles in the future.
